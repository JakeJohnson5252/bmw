# Landscaping Scheduler Project

## Vision

This project is a web application that allows users to select available timeslots for receiving an estimate for a landscaping job. It consists of two main components: the frontend web app and the backend database/API hosted on Supabase. The frontend communicates with the backend via REST API calls.
